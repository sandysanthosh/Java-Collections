Here are some **Spring Boot annotations interview questions** to help you prepare:

### 1. **What is `@SpringBootApplication`?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - It is a convenience annotation that combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`.
     - It is typically placed on the main application class to enable automatic configuration and component scanning.
   
   - **Follow-up Question**: What is the purpose of `@EnableAutoConfiguration` inside `@SpringBootApplication`?

### 2. **What is `@RestController` and how is it different from `@Controller`?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - `@RestController` is a combination of `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`. It is used to create RESTful web services. 
     - `@Controller` is used for handling web requests and returning views, whereas `@RestController` returns data directly in JSON or XML format.
   
   - **Follow-up Question**: Can you explain the purpose of `@ResponseBody` in Spring Boot?

### 3. **What is the role of `@RequestMapping` annotation?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - It is used to map web requests to specific handler methods in classes annotated with `@Controller` or `@RestController`.
     - It can be used at both class and method levels to define request paths, HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), and other request parameters.
   
   - **Follow-up Question**: What is the difference between `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, and `@RequestMapping`?

### 4. **What does `@Autowired` do in Spring Boot?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - It is used to automatically inject dependencies into a Spring-managed bean.
     - It can be applied to fields, constructors, and setter methods.
   
   - **Follow-up Question**: How does Spring Boot resolve dependencies with `@Autowired` and how does it manage multiple beans of the same type?

### 5. **What is the use of `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller` annotations?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - These are specializations of `@Component` for different layers in the Spring application:
       - `@Component`: A generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component.
       - `@Service`: Used for business logic or service classes.
       - `@Repository`: Used for persistence logic (e.g., DAO classes).
       - `@Controller`: Used for controller classes in MVC architecture.
   
   - **Follow-up Question**: How does Spring handle component scanning for these annotations?

### 6. **What is `@Configuration` and when would you use it?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - It is used to define a class that provides configuration metadata for the Spring container.
     - Methods inside the class annotated with `@Bean` are used to create and configure beans that are managed by the Spring container.
   
   - **Follow-up Question**: What is the difference between `@Configuration` and `@Component`?

### 7. **Explain the purpose of `@Bean` annotation in Spring Boot.**
   - **Answer**: 
     - It is used to declare a bean (i.e., an object) that should be managed by the Spring container. 
     - It is typically used in configuration classes to manually define beans.
   
   - **Follow-up Question**: What is the difference between using `@Bean` and `@Autowired`?

### 8. **What is the `@Qualifier` annotation, and when would you use it?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - It is used to resolve ambiguity when there are multiple beans of the same type, and you need to specify which one should be injected.
     - It works with `@Autowired` to select a specific bean by name or qualifier.

### 9. **What is `@Value` in Spring Boot and how is it used?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - It is used to inject values into fields, typically from properties files or environment variables.
     - You can inject values like `@Value("${property.name}")` to access properties.

   - **Follow-up Question**: How do you access environment-specific properties using `@Value`?

### 10. **What is `@Profile` in Spring Boot?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - It is used to define beans that should only be loaded in specific environments or profiles (e.g., dev, prod).
     - It helps in configuring different beans or configurations based on the active profile.
   
   - **Follow-up Question**: How can you activate a specific profile in a Spring Boot application?

### 11. **What is `@Entity` and how is it related to JPA in Spring Boot?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - It is a JPA annotation that marks a class as a persistent entity (mapped to a database table).
     - In Spring Boot, JPA entities are managed by Spring Data JPA, and the `@Entity` annotation helps in defining the mapping between Java objects and database tables.
   
   - **Follow-up Question**: What is the purpose of `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue` in JPA?

### 12. **Explain the `@Transactional` annotation.**
   - **Answer**: 
     - It is used to manage transaction boundaries in Spring applications.
     - When applied to a method, it ensures that the method runs within a transaction, and if any exception occurs, the transaction is rolled back.
   
   - **Follow-up Question**: What are the default behaviors of `@Transactional` for rollback and commit?

### 13. **What is `@EnableCaching` in Spring Boot?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - It enables caching in a Spring Boot application.
     - You can use it in conjunction with annotations like `@Cacheable`, `@CacheEvict`, and `@CachePut` to manage cache-related behavior.
   
   - **Follow-up Question**: How does `@Cacheable` work, and when would you use it?

### 14. **What is `@EnableScheduling` in Spring Boot?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - It is used to enable scheduling capabilities in a Spring Boot application, allowing you to run tasks at scheduled intervals using the `@Scheduled` annotation.
   
   - **Follow-up Question**: How can you schedule tasks with cron expressions using `@Scheduled`?

### 15. **What is `@ExceptionHandler` used for in Spring Boot?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - It is used to handle exceptions in a Spring controller.
     - When an exception occurs, the method annotated with `@ExceptionHandler` can handle it and return a custom response or view.
   
   - **Follow-up Question**: How can you handle exceptions globally in a Spring Boot application?

   - **Purpose**: 
     - It is used to define additional `@Configuration` classes that will be used only in test scenarios.
   - **Use case**: 
     - Helpful when you need a specific configuration or bean only for testing purposes.

   - **Follow-up Question**: How does `@TestConfiguration` differ from `@Configuration`?

### 3. **`@ConditionalOnProperty`**
   - **Purpose**: 
     - It is used to conditionally enable or disable a Spring component (e.g., a bean or configuration) based on the presence and value of a specific property in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.
