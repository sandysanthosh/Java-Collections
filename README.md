Here are some common **Java Collections** interview questions with concise answers:

### 1. **What is the Java Collections Framework (JCF)?**
   - **Java Collections Framework** is a set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly reusable data structures like lists, sets, maps, and queues. It provides several utilities for operations like searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

### 2. **What are the main interfaces of the Java Collections Framework?**
   - **Collection**: The root interface for working with groups of objects.
   - **List**: Ordered collection (can contain duplicates), e.g., `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`.
   - **Set**: Unordered collection that does not allow duplicates, e.g., `HashSet`, `TreeSet`.
   - **Queue**: Collection used to hold elements for processing, often in a FIFO order, e.g., `PriorityQueue`, `LinkedList`.
   - **Map**: Stores key-value pairs, e.g., `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, `LinkedHashMap`.

### 3. **What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?**
   - **ArrayList**:
     - Backed by a dynamic array.
     - Better for frequent access or search operations (`O(1)` for get).
     - Slower in insertion or deletion from the middle of the list (`O(n)`).
   - **LinkedList**:
     - Doubly linked list structure.
     - Faster for insertion and deletion (`O(1)`).
     - Slower for random access (`O(n)`).

### 4. **What is the difference between `HashSet` and `TreeSet`?**
   - **HashSet**:
     - Implements `Set` using a hash table.
     - Provides constant time performance (`O(1)`) for basic operations (add, remove, contains).
     - No ordering of elements.
   - **TreeSet**:
     - Implements `Set` using a Red-Black Tree.
     - Provides log-time (`O(log n)`) performance for basic operations.
     - Elements are sorted in natural order or according to a custom `Comparator`.

### 5. **What is the difference between `HashMap` and `Hashtable`?**
   - **HashMap**:
     - Non-synchronized, not thread-safe.
     - Allows one null key and multiple null values.
     - Faster due to no synchronization overhead.
   - **Hashtable**:
     - Synchronized, thread-safe.
     - Does not allow null keys or values.
     - Slower due to synchronization.

### 6. **What is the difference between `HashMap` and `TreeMap`?**
   - **HashMap**:
     - Uses a hash table for storage, provides constant time (`O(1)`) for basic operations.
     - No guaranteed order for iteration.
   - **TreeMap**:
     - Uses a Red-Black Tree for storage, provides log time (`O(log n)`) for basic operations.
     - Maintains keys in sorted order.

### 7. **What is the difference between `List` and `Set`?**
   - **List**:
     - Ordered collection, elements can be accessed by index.
     - Allows duplicate elements.
   - **Set**:
     - Unordered collection, elements are not indexed.
     - Does not allow duplicates.

### 8. **What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `Vector`?**
   - **ArrayList**:
     - Non-synchronized, not thread-safe.
     - Grows dynamically by 50% when resized.
     - Preferred for single-threaded applications.
   - **Vector**:
     - Synchronized, thread-safe.
     - Grows dynamically by 100% (doubles in size).
     - Slower due to synchronization.

### 9. **What is the purpose of `Iterator` and how does it differ from `ListIterator`?**
   - **Iterator**:
     - Provides a way to traverse through elements of a collection.
     - Can remove elements while iterating.
     - Works with all collections that implement `Collection` interface.
     - Only moves forward.
   - **ListIterator**:
     - Extends `Iterator` and works with `List` interface.
     - Can traverse the list in both directions (forward and backward).
     - Allows adding, removing, and modifying elements during iteration.

### 10. **What is a `ConcurrentHashMap`? How is it different from `HashMap`?**
   - **ConcurrentHashMap**:
     - Thread-safe implementation of `HashMap`.
     - Uses a lock-striping mechanism to allow multiple threads to read/write to different segments concurrently.
     - Provides higher concurrency than `Hashtable` and avoids global locking.
   - **HashMap**:
     - Not thread-safe and should not be used in multi-threaded environments.

### 11. **Explain the concept of fail-fast and fail-safe iterators.**
   - **Fail-fast Iterators**:
     - Immediately throw `ConcurrentModificationException` if the collection is structurally modified while iterating, except through the iterator's own `remove()` method. Example: `ArrayList`, `HashMap`.
   - **Fail-safe Iterators**:
     - Do not throw exceptions if the collection is modified. They operate on a cloned copy of the collection during iteration. Example: `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`.

### 12. **What is the difference between `peek()`, `poll()`, and `remove()` in a `Queue`?**
   - **peek()**: Retrieves the head of the queue without removing it, returns `null` if the queue is empty.
   - **poll()**: Retrieves and removes the head of the queue, returns `null` if the queue is empty.
   - **remove()**: Retrieves and removes the head of the queue, throws an exception if the queue is empty.

### 13. **How does `HashMap` work internally?**
   - `HashMap` uses an array of `Node` objects where each entry is stored as a key-value pair. The key’s hash code determines the index in the array where the entry is stored.
   - If multiple keys have the same hash code (hash collision), `HashMap` stores these entries in a linked list or, since Java 8, in a balanced tree if the list becomes too long.

### 14. **What are the best practices for using `HashMap`?**
   - Choose a proper initial capacity and load factor to avoid resizing overhead.
   - Use immutable keys, such as `String` or `Integer`, to ensure correct behavior in the map.
   - Ensure that `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are implemented correctly for keys.

### 15. **What is the difference between `Comparable` and `Comparator`?**
   - **Comparable**:
     - Used to define the natural ordering of objects, with the `compareTo()` method.
     - Implemented directly by the class whose objects are being compared.
     ```java
     public class Person implements Comparable<Person> {
         public int compareTo(Person p) { return this.name.compareTo(p.name); }
     }
     ```
   - **Comparator**:
     - Used to define an external comparison logic, with the `compare()` method.
     - Implemented as a separate class to provide different ways of ordering objects.
     ```java
     Comparator<Person> ageComparator = (p1, p2) -> p1.getAge() - p2.getAge();
     ```

### 16. **How does `LinkedHashMap` differ from `HashMap`?**
   - **LinkedHashMap** maintains the order of insertion, meaning elements are iterated in the order they were added.
   - **HashMap** does not maintain any order of elements.

### 17. **What is a `PriorityQueue` in Java?**
   - A `PriorityQueue` is a queue that orders elements based on their natural order or a custom comparator. It does not allow null elements, and it orders elements according to their priority (lowest first by default).

### 18. **What is `CopyOnWriteArrayList`?**
   - **CopyOnWriteArrayList** is a thread-safe variant of `ArrayList` where all mutative operations (add, set, etc.) result in creating a new copy of the underlying array. It’s ideal for read-heavy environments with rare updates.

### 19. **What is the difference between `Synchronized Collection` and `Concurrent Collection`?**
   - **Synchronized Collection**: Uses synchronization to allow only one thread to access the collection at a time. Example: `Collections.synchronizedList()`.
   - **Concurrent Collection**: Designed for concurrent access without locking the entire data structure. Example: `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`.

### 20. **What is `EnumSet`?**
   - **EnumSet** is a specialized `Set` implementation designed to work with enum types. It is highly efficient and offers better performance than other Set implementations when dealing with enums.
